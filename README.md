## React JS Roadmap
   
### Why Learn React?

- **Trending and Widely Used**: React is a popular choice for building user interfaces.
- **Managing Complex Frontends**: While UI can be built with jQuery and CSS libraries, React simplifies the management and construction of complex frontends.
    - **Complex Frontends**: React efficiently handles state changes, ensuring that updates in one part of the application reflect seamlessly across the entire UI.

### When Should I Learn React?

- **Project Phases**: Most projects don't need React in the initial phase.
- **Simple Tasks**: Simple tasks like fetching data from an API and displaying it in a card do not require React.

### Why Was React Created?

- **Phantom Message Problem on Facebook**
- **State Management**: JavaScript manages the state (like variables), while the Document Object Model (DOM) manages the UI.

  - **State and UI Synchronization**: The state, such as the message count, is stored in a variable and displayed in the UI. Before React, state and DOM were not synchronized, causing state changes to not reflect directly in the UI without a refresh.

- **Early Adopters**: Khan Academy and Unsplash were among the first to use React in their projects.

### React Learning Process

1. **Go In-Depth**:
   - Learn Babel
   - Learn Fiber
   - Learn Virtual DOM
   - Learn Diffing Algorithm
   - Learn Hydration

2. **By Making Projects**:
   - Apply the in-depth topics by building projects.

### React is a Library!

- [Framework vs. Library](https://www.programmingcube.com/framework-vs-library/)

- **Frameworks**: Follow certain rules, e.g., Django.
- **Libraries**: Offer freedom and flexibility, e.g., React.

### Topics to Learn

- **Core Concepts**: State and UI Manipulation, JSX (HTML embedded in JavaScript).
- **Component Reusability**: Use props to reuse components like cards, footers, headers, etc., in different places.
- **Propagating Changes**: Learn about hooks for managing state and effects.

### Additional Add-ons for React

*React enables single-page applications without reloading. To manage URLs, use `react-router`.*

- **Router**: React does not have a built-in router.
  - Install `react-router-dom` to use routing in React projects.
- **State Management**: React does not include built-in state management.
    - Use libraries like `Redux`, `Redux Toolkit` (an abstraction of Redux), Zustand, or `Context API` (all JavaScript libraries).
- **Class-Based Components**: Used in legacy code; modern React uses functional components.
- **BAAS Apps (Backend as a Service)**:
    - Utilize services like Firebase or Supabase to avoid writing backend from scratch.
    - Create social media clones, e-commerce apps, etc., using BAAS.

### After Learning React

- **Limitations**: React does not have built-in SEO capabilities, JavaScript rendering on the server, or default routing.
- **Frameworks**:
  - **Next.js**: Integrates backend and frontend within a single page.
  - **Gatsby**
  - **Remix**
